# Page-Replacement-Algorithm-Simulator

# Introduction
The Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator is a program designed to simulate different page replacement algorithms commonly used in operating systems. It provides a visual representation of how these algorithms manage memory pages, track page hits and faults, and optimize memory usage.

# Supported Algorithms
The simulator currently supports the following page replacement algorithms:<br />
1)FIFO (First-In-First-Out)<br />
2)LRU (Least Recently Used)<br />

# Features
1)Interactive Simulation: Users can input page requests and select an algorithm to start the simulation.<br />
2)Memory Visualization: The simulator visualizes memory blocks and their contents, highlighting page replacements and hits.<br />
3)Algorithm Controls: Users can start, pause, reset, and switch between algorithms during the simulation.<br />
4)Results Section: Displays the number of page hits and page faults for each algorithm run.<br />

# Simulation Interface<br />
1)Enter page requests separated by spaces in the input field.<br />
2)Select a page replacement algorithm from the dropdown list.<br />
2)Click the "Submit" button to start the simulation.<br />
3)Use the control buttons (Start, Pause, Reset) to manage the simulation.<br />
4)View the memory visualization and results section to track page hits and faults during the simulation.<br />
