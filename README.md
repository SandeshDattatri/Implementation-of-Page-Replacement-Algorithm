# Page-Replacement-Algorithm-Simulator

# Introduction
The Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator is a program designed to simulate different page replacement algorithms commonly used in operating systems. It provides a visual representation of how these algorithms manage memory pages, track page hits and faults, and optimize memory usage.

# Supported Algorithms
The simulator currently supports the following page replacement algorithms:
1)FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
2)LRU (Least Recently Used)

# Features
1)Interactive Simulation: Users can input page requests and select an algorithm to start the simulation.
2)Memory Visualization: The simulator visualizes memory blocks and their contents, highlighting page replacements and hits.
3)Algorithm Controls: Users can start, pause, reset, and switch between algorithms during the simulation.
4)Results Section: Displays the number of page hits and page faults for each algorithm run.

# Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/username/page-replacement-simulator.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd page-replacement-simulator

# Simulation Interface
1)Enter page requests separated by spaces in the input field.
2)Select a page replacement algorithm from the dropdown list.
2)Click the "Submit" button to start the simulation.
3)Use the control buttons (Start, Pause, Reset) to manage the simulation.
4)View the memory visualization and results section to track page hits and faults during the simulation.
